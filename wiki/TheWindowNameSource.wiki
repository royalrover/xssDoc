=== The Window Name Source === 

Characters in window.name value are invariant to the way they have been given.
Which means that if a !JavaScript application sets:

{{{
window.name='a\x01b'
}}}

no encoding is applied.

Window.name attribute is always a cast to the string representation of the object it is assigned to.

The window.name attribute is a persistent value during the existence of the page to which is assigned.

An attacker can set new windows names and frames with no restriction, and they will persist during navigation on any domain.
