=== Indirect Sources ===

(TBA)


==== Storage Object ====

HTML 5 Storage objects [#References [6]][#References  [7]][#References [8] ] can be considered an indirect source, since they can be used to store values from direct sources and use them later insecurely.

Indirect source objects are:

 * localStorage 
 * sessionStorage
 * IndexedDB (mozIndexedDB, webkitIndexedDB, msIndexedDB)
 * Database (Safari Only)

==== Server Response Sources ====

Previously server side stored data could be used by an attacker to send untrusted input 
to Javascript.
