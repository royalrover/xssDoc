= DOMXSS Wiki =

The DOMXSS Wiki is a Knowledge Base for defining sources of attacker controlled inputs and sinks which potentially could introduce DOM Based XSS issues. DOMXSS first being thoroughly documented in a [http://www.webappsec.org/projects/articles/071105.html paper by Amit Klein] in 2005 has risen in relevance over the last years - nevertheless still lacking a central place for collecting information and knowledge about it.

The project aims top be this very place and to identify sources and sinks methods exposed by public, widely used javascript frameworks. The project is a work in progress and will be extended over time. Contributions are welcome.
