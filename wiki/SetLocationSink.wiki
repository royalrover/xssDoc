= Location Sink =

Window.location (or document.location) and its members can be a source and a sink `[`[References 1]`]`
The window.location object can be used to take the browser to another page by simply
assigning a string to it.

Eg.
{{{
window.location = "http://example.com/a/page.ext?par=val#hash"
}}}

== The object assignment == 

 * location
 * location.href
 * location.pathname
 * location.search
 * location.protocol
 * location.hostname

An unvalidated assignment to each of the listed objects could lead,
to some extent, to security issues.

*Important Note*
Internet Explorer 8 will decode entities to their original values if they are somewhere present in the left value.

E.g.
{{{
 location="javascript&#x3a;alert(1)";
}}}

&#x3a; (or its decimal analogue &#58;) will be converted to ':'.
Other browsers like Firefox (3.6), Opera (10), Chrome (5), Safari (5) don't replace entities to their converted chars.
