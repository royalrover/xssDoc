=== How to read tables ===
Tables contents describe output given some input.
Headers are:

 * *source*: Javascript object name
 * *browser*: Browser Name
 * *version*: Browser version tested
 * *pathInfo*: characters that are not urlencoded in the pathInfo part
 * *Search*: characters that are not urlencoded in the search part
 * *Hash*:  characters that are not urlencoded in the hash part
 * *output sample*: A sample of the output given by getting the property, if needed.

Sometimes you'll find something like `[`A-B`]`, that means that it has to be considered the whole interval of ascii characters from A to B.

The missing characters in the table elements are to be considered urlencoded, if described otherwise and excluding */`[`a-z0-9`]`/i*

Finally, some interesting characters are bold.
